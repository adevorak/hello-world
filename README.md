# hello-world
Just another repository 
Hi coders! I have no clue what I am doing. What is a computer? Help me please! This feels like driving for the first time- who is in control of this machine? I should NOT be behind the wheel! Repositories, branches, commits- what exactly are we talking about here? LOL But seriously, it's time for CS-50 goals. My goal is: by the end of this course, to be able to hack into the security system of Jurassic Park and save everyone when the dinosaurs inevitably go rogue. Thanks, bye.
